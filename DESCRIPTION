Description: Spatial structural diversity refers to the spatial, i.e. horizontal arrangement of landscape elements and can reveal itself as landscape features, such as patches and line features. The 'R' package 'StrucDiv' provides methods to quantify spatial structural diversity in continuous remote sensing data, or in other data in raster format. The methods are based on second-order texture metrics, considering the spatial arrangement of value pairs. The 'R' package 'StrucDiv' includes methods to combine information from different spatial scales with an empirical Bayesian approach, which allows to detect multi-scale spatial structural diversity.
